# VagrantPress - ClI extension

*VagrantPress - CLI* extension is a package based on vagrantpress by [chadthompson]. This package is altered to use it in combination with wordpress CLI and Woocommerce

## Getting Started

This is a fairly simple project to get up and running.  The procedure for starting up a working WordPress is as follows:

1. Clone the project.  (Thereâ€™s only master branch.)
2. Run the command `vagrant up`
3. Open your browser to http://localhost:8080

To log in to the local Wordpress installation at http://localhost:8080/wp-admin/ the username is `admin`, the password is `vagrant`.
